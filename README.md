# Cat ðŸ˜º Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates cat face detection using OpenCV. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library, to detect cats in images. The implementation utilizes pre-trained Haar cascade classifier and draw bounding boxes around cats present in the input images.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have  installed:
* OpenCV

You can install the required packages using command: 
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```
##  Training the Model
The Haar cascade classifier used in this project is pre-trained.
### Haar Cascade Classifiers
Haar cascades are a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or video. They are based on the Haar wavelet technique, which is a mathematical concept used in image processing. Haar cascades are trained from positive and negative images to detect specific objects, such as faces, eyes, or in your case, cats.

Just run [Code.py](https://github.com/Vicky9890/Cat_Face_Detection_Model/blob/master/Code.py) for Training the model.
